## Peer Review: Robert G

- When size is at **375px**, it still behaves like a desktop layout. I would recommend using `md:` instead of `sm`.
- Not sure if it's my screen, but a lot of the sizing was off on both **desktop and mobile**.
- The **input** should maintain `focus` when the user is typing something.
- **Buttons** do not have an active state when being used.
- The **reset button** is sometimes slow to apply the changes.
- I would recommend moving your **code** out of `app.jsx`.
